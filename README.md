# SLYND - ALX Portfolio Project

# My Coding Adventure

In 2019, I started coding, and by 2024, I decided to tackle a blog app using Django and React. Why? Because why not! üòÖ

Building SLYND was a wild ride. The most epic challenge? Debugging a feature to fetch related posts‚Äîspent 5 hours on 10 lines of codeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I stumbled, I searched, and I asked AI for help (thank you, tech gods!). But in the end, I had a blog app that actually works(i think). üéâ

## I. Frameworks

1. Django - Backend framework for building the server-side of the application.
2. React - Frontend library for building user interfaces.

## II. Programming Languages

1. Python - Used for the backend, handling server logic, database interaction, and APIs.
2. JavaScript - Used for the frontend with React to create dynamic web pages.

## III. Project Description

SLYND is a blog application that allows users to:

- Create, edit, and delete blog posts.
- View posts created by other users.
- Comment on posts.
- Like and share posts.
- Search for posts by title or content.

## IV. Features

1. User authentication (signup, login, logout).
2. Blog post creation with rich text support.
3. Commenting and interaction (likes, shares).
